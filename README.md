# Hello, my name is CÃ©dric! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have just completed training as a data analyst, marking a reorientation in my career after 14 years as a network and systems security administrator. With this new skill, I am looking for opportunities for a Junior Data Analyst position, while remaining open to roles that would take advantage of my IT expertise.
